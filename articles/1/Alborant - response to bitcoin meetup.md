Ok, I'll try to keep the language as formal as possible while I try to expose my arguments.
What I can't do is prevent some opinions from being ofensive was you surelly understand.
I too take some ofense when people are willing to intensionally (and very politely) misinform about this subjects.

Full disclosure, I'm quite a cynical pr**k...ups, lets keep it forma, I meant "person", about human nature so I'll just start with my most offensive point of view.

I believe the main motivation behind bitcoin (not in its cypherpunk inception of course but in it's unwillingness to retire gracefully) is not to strive for technological development or a fairer society but greed (although there are some genuine ambitious projects) and ignorance (mainly "strategic ignorance" which is quite smart).

You criticized my post as being "resentful" (not the most formal and respectful way to criticize and it's basically an ad hominem strategy by the way) and although a more accurate definition would be "annoyed" (formal term for "pis**d") you're not completely wrong, there's indeed a little of that.
I do tend to despise "wall street" culture and in fact I'm a little jealous (does jealousy lead to resentfulness or is it the other way around) of those highly intelligent finance guys (and girls...let's be inclusive), capable of coldly and insidefully (...I mean insightfully) devising strategies optimized to make huge amounts of money with minimum work, and still be able to rationalize it as a great thing.
Luckily I'm a just a simple guy that wouldn't even know how to spend that kind of money. I would be embarrassed not to be able to appreciate all of those luxury items (except few that I'm quite a fan). I would probably just end up spending my time geeking with things like web-dev-things and crypto-stuff... netflix, friends, beer... I don't even enjoy craft beer that much. (Coruja IPA from superbock is great though)
I wouldn't say I'm resentful about this "wall street" take on cryptocurrencies (I can't even complain about my life because I'm quite privileged actually...I'm white, male and have a very, very thick hair) but more that I'm annoyed by the fact that it's extremely difficult to talk about the real interesting and world changing aspects of the technology instead of the usual bubble blowing, ICO justifying talk. It's like watching some kid trying to break the biggest bubble gum bubble record. Its just fair it blows in they're own speculating faces.

I agree that this kind of gold rush can somewhat speed development but not has much as "traders" try to suggest.
First, the idea that Bitcoin is such a ground breaking technology invented by this nerd-genius/manga-superhero Satoshi Nakamoto (I know it's probably not one guy but I'm going with the "Satoshi and his sidegeeks", pun intended, popular image) is a little ridiculous.

My background is not in CS in 2 minutes anyone can understand that "Distributed Computing" which includes "Consensus Algorithms" has been around for quite a while.
From PoW wiki page: "The concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor as presented in a 1993 journal article"
From RSA wiki page: "Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978"
The blockchain itself probably has a lot "prior art"...just googled and tldr'ed this https://medium.com/blockstreethq/before-blockchain-there-was-distributed-ledger-technology-319d0295f0117

Of course has you might aspect by my crankiness I'm also not a fan of Jobs either and although I'll admit he had a rare talent spotting other people's ideas, wiring the best engineers (the millions made by the excellence of Steve "golden egg goose" Wozniak engineering in the fist Apple computers might have helped a tiny bit) and impeccable taste picking designers to package it beautifully to the rich premium Apple costumers, not even Apple was that ground breaking http://torgronsund.com/2014/11/29/government-apple-innovation/
...but I digress.

Back to the subject at hand, the Bitcoin carbon footprint.
Or even better focusing on the REAL problem because the subject is at best a smart distracting maneuver.
The real problem is if Bitcoin does event make sense and any other crypto currency for that matter.
My first argument against Bitcoin is that the technology is outdated and the only reason it's still around is obviously pyramidal (last pun I promise...)
The focus energy consumption and complicated incentive schemes is also somewhat disingenuous and I suspect the real goal is to surreptitiously justify itself has an inherent characteristic of any crypto currency technology.

I agree that in a perverse way greed stimulates innovation (and I guess also "cold war" as lots of technology came from the military) but is quite disheartening to hear so much talk about incentives and not recognizing the work of the those intellectuals academics and their quite contrasting incentives and motivations.

My view in the subject is that the a bulk of the technology research is made by academics and government funded labs (either directly or indirectly by allowing circumvention of antitrust laws or avoid scrutiny in public procurements) and Bitcoin surely had the merit of being the first to show a POC to the world.
And regardless of government corruption the technology of money is more than the mere logistics of it.
I'll argue it's basically ethical and political machinery now and the logistics that bitcoin and the others try to solve are soon to be efficient and free as any other protocol.
Enough with the "one coin to rule them all" and "bitcoin as a reserve currency" nonsense. It starts to be rude to so blatantly deceive people.

I don't know (and couldn't find) this gentleman's theory about bitcoin consumption (which will inevitable escalate in a properly working protocol unless there's cartelization..oh wait..there is) but I'm assuming he would be articulating some attenuating factors about the inevitable energy consumption. The real question is how much energy are we willing to waste on a bubble?

Doesn't he acknowledges the advancements made in this field? He's he going to address the fact new solutions like Algorand don't require mining at all? (the team developing Algorand is led by Silvio Micali, it's not some shady mickey mouse algorithm).

He's also in the origin of Zero Knowledge cryptography, one of the real world changing innovations. zcash style transaction are just the tip of the iceberg.
It also allows attribute based credentials already implemented in Hyperledger Indy.
By the way, Hyperledger is a Linux Foundation Project where all the big players are collaborating developing this technologies and its quite mature now.
It will very soon be used has a permissioned ledger between financial institutions
Very soon financial institutions will have all accounting implemented in some Heperledger permissioned blockchain, soon after we'll be able to pay with smartphones and that's it.
Goodbye bitcoin. Bitcoin is only good while there are ingenuous people that believe there's a change of it becoming a real currency.
Bitcoin it's not viable with only the smart bubble riding savvy traders left

This is not a pessimistic view nor am I implying that everything will remain the same, quite the opposite, I'm actually quite excited and optimist about this cryptography based emerging technologies.
"Crypto currencies" and "self enforcing contracts" are just dull upgrade of the technological infrastructure of the same old "financial engineering" machinery at best.
At worst, as Paul Krugman points out, (Bitcoin) will “Set the Monetary System Back 300 Years”

The main reason I posted about Algorand is because it utterly exposes the obsolescence of bitcoins and PoW and NOT addressing this essentially stock-fraud in my book.

So, although I would be happy to share my thought the subject I'm quite convinced that my opinions are the last thing you want to hear.
