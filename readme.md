# Collaborative article about "blockchain" technology.

The name was inspired by the proliferation of (intentionally??) deceitful articles about "blockchain" technology that fail acknowledges the existence of Algorand and similar advances in this area.

I'll created a first PR with my post on the [Bitcoin and its Energy Footprint](https://www.meetup.com/Social-at-The-Block-Cafe/events/256939248/) meetup event so feel free to share your insights there or criticize my arguments.
